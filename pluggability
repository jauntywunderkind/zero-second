# multi-level pluggability

ok so

i've been working on this voodoo-opt thing for a bit.  and, it's ok. it primes some basics, puts them on tap.

but i want a multi-level extensible system.

`~/.config/voodoo-opt` should accept plugins, and they should empower & enable all voodoo-opt using programs.

if you extend voodoo-opt, ~/.config/your-layer should plug too. more and more layers, on & on, each pluggable.

ideally, we can late bound things. look for default impls at each lib layer, the code layer, but only as a fallback to the configured layer. if i divine IFS in voodoo-opt then ~/.config/voodoo-opt/IFS.js ought be able to overwrite. but that in turn is less than your-app's IFS & less in turn than ~/config/your-app/IFS.js.

currently voodoo-opt relies on a lot of synchronous definitions of things, but these need to be made less so.
