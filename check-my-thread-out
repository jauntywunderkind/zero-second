small web experience

thread reposting, that asks users to reconsider which of the contained points are more interesting, more compelling to them

trying to encourage folks to re-explore the long threads that they otherwise would fade out through

totally completely a result of me being a terrible threader, building micro-megas, here & there, re-weaving, re-litigating, re-expressing the past in large neandering threads that reconstruct near & far past
