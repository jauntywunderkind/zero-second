thanks for breaking everything. set me free.

the tabs must be wrangled, now. i have to set them into order.

it's not like the signs weren't in the air. google broke not just the public's rss reader but they broke my personal one too. a decade ago they broke what i had what i did, aborted my attempt to beam myself information, to make ambient to me the happening world.

it's a good use of a point a week. a point. another project, a good one, a soul one. your own limited allocator, your own delegator. this is such a good idea. the weekly score, so delightful & fun. let a million projects bloom. let the sequence, the histories, bloom.
